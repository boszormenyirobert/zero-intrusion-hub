				Zero Intrusion Lock & Layered Encryption protects every step of the authentication process. From the
				            moment a company registers to the point a user logs in, all data is encrypted,
				            validated, and verified.

					<strong>
						Unauthorized Access Prevention:
					</strong>
					Each QR code is time-limited (max 2 minutes) and unique per session.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Keystore Protection:
					</strong>
					Device-side hashes are securely stored in the mobile device‚Äôs Keystore,
					              protecting against malware or extraction.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Encrypted Communication:
					</strong>
					All data is transmitted via HTTPS using modern TLS protocols.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Tamper-Resistant:
					</strong>
					No sensitive information is stored on servers in plain form. Encrypted
					              hashes and JWT tokens ensure data cannot be altered (protecting against
					<strong>
						unauthorized changes
					</strong>
					).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				These layers work together to deliver a system that‚Äôs resistant to phishing,
				            replay attacks, credential stuffing, and man-in-the-middle exploits. In
				            cybersecurity terms, this is a significant leap forward compared to static
				            passwords or even email-token systems.

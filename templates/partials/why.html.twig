				Traditional user registration and login systems are slow, repetitive,
				            and frustrating. From email verification to password creation, security
				            questions, and confirmation emails, the entire process often requires multiple
				            clicks, form fields, and time-consuming steps. Most users give up midway,
				            reuse passwords, or struggle with forgotten credentials.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zero Intrusion Lock & Layered Encryption was created to solve this. Our goal: make authentication effortless
				            and secure with one simple action ‚Äì scanning a QR code. For users, it takes
				            seconds. For businesses, it offers industrial-grade protection against
				            unauthorized access and account compromise.

				QR codes are not new â€“ but using them as the core of a cryptographic identity
				            and access flow is. Zero Intrusion Lock & Layered Encryption turns QR codes into secure, encrypted containers
				            that transfer key information directly to the mobile device. From there,
				            validation is local and locked to the hardware.

				            Users donâ€™t need to type anything. No app-switching. No password resets.
				            Just one scan, and they are securely logged in.
